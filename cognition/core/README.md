# Core module

The module `cognition/core` consists of plain old Java object (POJOs). These objects are responsible for the business
logic of Cognition.

Currently, `coginition/core` only has a [`Flashcard`](../../cognition/core/src/main/java/core/Flashcard.java) class and
a corresponding simple test called [`FlashcardTest`](../../cognition/core/src/test/java/core/FlashcardTest.java).
