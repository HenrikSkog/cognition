# UI module (frontend)

The module `cognition/ui` handles the user interface of the app. It applies the library [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) to
create an interactive graphical interface.

So far, the user interface only consists of the login screen and has no functionality. Throughout future milestones, the
interface will be styled according to the mockup screenshots in the [`cognition/README.md`](../../cognition/README.md)
and be a functional flashcard app.
