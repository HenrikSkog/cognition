# Cognition

## Description

Cognition is - plain and simple - a flashcard application. If you've used [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/), Cognition
should feel quite familiar.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Cognition allows you to create, view, update and delete flashcards. These flashcards can be grouped together to create a
quiz; a collection of flashcards.

### Improvements and future functionality

As a user, you can view your streaks, in other words how many consecutive flashcards you've answered correctly. The
flashcards can be grouped by priority, for example grouped by the hardest questions or grouped by the ones you've gotten
most wrong.

The quizzes and flashcards are stored persistently, such that you as a user can quit Cognition and resume from where you
left off.

As a user, you can also search quizzes and flashcards for easier and more intuitive navigation.
